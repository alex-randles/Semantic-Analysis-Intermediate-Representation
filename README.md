# Semantic Analysis and Intermediate Representation.

The aim of this assignment is to add semantic analysis checks and intermediate representation generation to the lexical and syntax analyser you have implement in Assignment 1 (https://github.com/randlea2/LexicalSyntaxAnalyser) . The generated intermediate code should be a 3-address code and stored in a file with the ".ir" extension.
